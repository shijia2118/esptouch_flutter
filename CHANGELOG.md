## 1.1.0-androidv2

* Android embedding v2. Includes [PR `#28`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/pull/28). Fixes [`#19`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/issues/19) and [`#29`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/issues/29).

## 1.0.0

* Migrate package to Dart's null safety language feature, requiring Dart 2.12 or higher. Close [`esptouch_flutter #17`](https://github.com/smaho-engineering/esptouch_flutter/issues/17).
* Add `const` constructor to `ESPTouchTaskParameter`, and make all fields final. In case you relied on the task parameter fields being mutable, use the `copyWith` method on the `ESPTouchTaskParameter`. 
* Add `const` constructor to `ESPTouchResult`.
* Update example app to null safety and remove anything deprecated. Simplify example app (no private, only one file, etc...).
